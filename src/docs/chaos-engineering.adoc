== Chaos Engineering ==
Chaos engineering is a very new practice where failure gets injected into the systems -- on production (!) -- in
order to find issues where the system is not able to deal properly with failures.

Multiple frameworks are emerging which cover the chaos injection topic:

* Application Level
** https://keyholesoftware.com/2015/12/15/failure-as-a-use-case-introducing-trouble-maker/[TroubleMaker]
** https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/[Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot]
** https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/fault-injection.html[Istio Fault Injection]
* Infrastructure Layer
** Chaos Toolkit for Kubernetes +
https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit-kubernetes


=== Open Issues ===

* What to support on which level? Does it make sense to mix Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot and Istio?
* A DevOps team will not be able to inject chaos at the Kubernetes infrastructure level
