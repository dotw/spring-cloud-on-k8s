== Deployment ==
The topic deployment can be split into different aspects

* Overall deployment process
* Deployment tooling to support single steps and/or the whole process
* Deployment of a microservice
* Deployment of configuration changes

There are some fundamental concepts which need to be applied to microservices in order to reduce the
downtime of the distributed system.

* Zero Downtime Deployments
* Forward compatibility of database schema updates
* Backwards compatibility of API changes, i.e. no breaking changes

=== Deployment Process & Tooling
The deployment process makes use of the following tools:

* https://helm.sh/[Helm] -- Kubernetes Package Manager
* https://draft.sh/[Draft] -- Buildpacks (known from Heroku)
* CI/CD -- TODO: Jenkins (X) or Spinnaker?
** Spinnaker -- https://www.spinnaker.io/
*** Chaos Monkey integration
*** ...
** Jenkins X
*** http://jenkins-x.io/developing/create-spring/
*** Uses Helm and Draft for Jenkins X
* https://kubeapps.com/[Kubeapps]
** This a kind of self service marketplace for Kubernetes

=== Deployment of a microservice
TODO

* Canary
* Blue Green Deployments
* Dark Launch


=== Deployment of configuration changes
See chapter <<Configuration>> for details on how a configuration change is deployed in Kubernetes.


=== Open Issues
TODO:

* Tools to build applications for deployment on K8s
** Skaffold: https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold
** Draft: https://github.com/Azure/draft
* Might Forge be an option: https://forge.sh/?
* Which tools to implement the deployment process?
** Jenkins X
** Spinnaker
** ...
