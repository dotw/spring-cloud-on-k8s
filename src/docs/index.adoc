WARNING: This documentation is work in progress. Many of the concepts need to be refined and validated by implementing
them in microservices.

NOTE: Some of the topics in the document are very opinionated by former projects where I was working on.
All topics are validated against a fork of the
https://github.com/mrumpf/spring-petclinic-microservices[spring-petclinic-microservices] project.
