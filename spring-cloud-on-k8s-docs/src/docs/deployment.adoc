== Deployment ==
The topic deployment can be split into different aspects

* Overall deployment process
* Deployment tooling to support single steps and/or the whole process
* Deployment of a microservice
* Deployment of configuration changes

There are some fundamental concepts which need to be applied to microservices in order to reduce the
downtime of the distributed system.

* Zero Downtime Deployments
* Forward compatibility of database schema updates
* Backwards compatibility of API changes, i.e. no breaking changes
