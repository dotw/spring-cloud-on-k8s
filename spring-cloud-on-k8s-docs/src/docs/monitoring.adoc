== Monitoring ==

=== Prometheus ===

There are plugins to automatically detect new services, deployed on Kubernetes and change the configuration to start scraping the metrics endpoints.

Prerequisite: Spring Boot 2.0 with Micrometer


=== OpenTracing ===
TODO: Istio also supports OpenTracing!

JaegerTracing: https://www.jaegertracing.io/

Support for all relevant technology stacks!

The challenge is that with each requests a set of headers "X-b3-..." (Zipkin only?) are propagated between the microservices.
Those properties need to be added to the thread context and sent out to any downstream services.
