== Kubernetes Architecture ==
The Kubernetes platform architecture significantly influences how Spring Cloud works on Kubernetes and whether
the Spring Cloud Kubernetes incubation project can be used out of the box or whether this implementation must be
tweaked further.

Assumption:

* Namespaces per environment (test, staging, prod, ...)
* One or more environments in one K8s cluster
* Multiple clusters communicating with each other (Microservice dependencies from one cluster into another)
* Using Istio to prevent microservices from calling each other inside one cluster
