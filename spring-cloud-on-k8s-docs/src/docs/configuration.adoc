== Configuration ==
Looking at the polyglot application landscape with different technology stacks, then the Spring Cloud Config server
will not survive the Kubernetes migration in the long run. Instead a more general approach must be taken.

The Spring Cloud Kubernetes incubator project extends the Spring Boot hierarchy of PropertySources by
another one that gets populated from the Kubernetes ConfigMaps and the Kubernetes Secrets.


=== Migration Path ===
The migration process

. Phase 1
.. Switch from Eureka first to Config-Server first approach
.. Align the configuration
. Phase 2
.. Bake the config file into the Docker image as part of the build process (12-factor apps, all config via
the process environment)
.. A config update will be a re-deployment!?

=== Open Issues ===

TODO: How to handle runtime updates of the configuration when it is part of the process environment?
