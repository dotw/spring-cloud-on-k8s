Migrating a Spring Boot application to Kubernetes, which heavily uses the Spring Cloud features of the Netflix OSS
project, is challenging because of the many overlaps and the various ways certain features can be implemented
in the Kubernetes world.

There is a project in Spring Cloud incubation, called Spring-Cloud-Kubernetes, which tackles a few of those issues,
but unfortunately it does not cover Istio yet. Istio is aiming to take over more of the Spring Cloud Netflix topics,
implementing them in a technology agnostic way.

The Spring Cloud Kubernetes project does some assumptions, like all applications are in the same K8s namespace, which
might not be the case in more complex Kubernetes setups.

=== Feature Overlap ===

The following table shows some of the overlaps between the Spring Cloud and Kubernetes with Istio.

The table borrows heavily from the RedHat developer article
https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/12/09/spring-cloud-for-microservices-compared-to-kubernetes/[Spring Cloud for Microservices Compared to Kubernetes]
which does not cover Istio because the publishing date of the article pre-dates the Istio release by almost six months.

=== Migration Path ===

A lot of Java based applications started adopting the Spring Cloud and especially the Netflix OSS stacks a few years
ago (Many of the Netflix OSS libraries have been made publicly available in 2012 and were adopted by the Spring
team in the following years).
In the light of hybrid clouds and the polyglot workloads that are migrated to those cloud environments, the focus on
Java only feels like a misfit, especially to those that started the journey towards Kubernetes as a platform for
all kind of applications.

This documentation also depicts migration paths from the pure Java to a polyglot application world where many
of the Netflix OSS features are provided out of the platform. A huge benefit would be that platform aspects
can be removed from application code, leading to cleaner and easier to maintain codebase.
