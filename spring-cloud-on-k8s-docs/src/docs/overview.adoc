Moving a Spring Boot application, which heavily uses the Spring Cloud features around the Netflix OSS project, to
Kubernetes (K8s) is challenging because of the many overlaps and the various ways certain features can be implemented
in Kubernetes.

There is a project in Spring Cloud incubation, called Spring-Cloud-Kubernetes, which tackles a few of those issues,
but unfortunately it does not cover Istio yet. Istio is aiming to takeover more of the Spring Cloud Netflix topics,
mplementing them in a technology agnostic way.

The Spring Cloud Kubernetes project does some assumptions, like all applications are in the same K8s namespace, which
might not be true in a more complex K8s setup.

=== Feature Overlap ===

The following table shows some of the overlaps between the Spring Cloud and Kubernetes with Istio.

The table borrows heavily from the RedHat developer article
https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/12/09/spring-cloud-for-microservices-compared-to-kubernetes/[Spring Cloud for Microservices Compared to Kubernetes]
which does not cover Istio because the publishing date of the article pre-dates the Istio release by almost six months.

=== Migration Path ===

A lot of Java based applications started adopting the Spring Cloud and especially the Netflix OSS stacks a few years
ago (Many of the Netflix OSS libraries have been made publicly available in 2012 and were adopted by the Spring
team in the following years).
In the light of hybrid clouds and the polyglot workloads that are supported on those cloud environments, the focus on
Java feels like a misfit, especially to those that started the journey towards Kubernetes as a platform for all kinds
of applications.

This documentation also depicts a migration path from the pure Java to a polyglot application world where many of the
Netflix OSS features are supported by the platform. The huge benefit can be that application logic can be freed
from platform aspects, leading to cleaner code.
