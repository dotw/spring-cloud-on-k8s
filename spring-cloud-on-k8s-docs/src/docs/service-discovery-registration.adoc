== Service Registration & Discovery ==

The service registration makes sure that each microservice registers its contact information in a central registry.
A microservice A consuming a microervice B, contacts the service registry and asks for the contact details of service
B. It gets a list of instances with its IP address and the port number.
On K8s the port is the same in each Docker container and the IP is a private IP ....
On Kubernetes there is no need for a Netflix Eureka anymore.
The load-balancing is done by the K8s services, which do a load-balancing between the pods, representing the instances
of an application.
