== Load Balancing ==
Load-Balancing in Kubernetes is defined by multiple factors.
There is no load balancer in Kubernetes itself. Instead, when creating a service of type LoadBalancer, a cloud
provider's load-balancer is provisioned as the Kubernetes service.
This makes the behavior of the load-balancer dependent on the cloud that is used underneath. Also in terms of
configuration AWS' Elastic Load Balancer is completely different to Azure, IBM, or the Google load
balancers.
