== Load Balancing ==
Load-Balancing in Kubernetes is defined by multiple factors.
There is no load balancer in Kubernetes itself. Instead, when creating a service of type LoadBalancer, a cloud
provider's load-balancer is provisioned as the Kubernetes service. That is the reason why it is currently not
possible for Minikube to create a resource of type LoadBalancer
(see https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/384[Loadbalancer support] for a solution)

This makes the behavior of the load-balancer dependent on the cloud that is used underneath. Also in terms of
configuration, configuring an AWS' Elastic Load Balancer is completely different to configuring
load-balancers on Azure, IBM, or on the Google cloud.
